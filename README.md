# Telecom Churn Case Study and Churn Prediction
**Problem Statement and Business Objective:**

In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. As a data scientist, your task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

The company wants to know:
- Whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). 
- It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
- Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your observations.

## Conclusions
- We have build Logistic and Random forest model.We went ahead with Random forest model to predict churn output ,since it's accuracy is 92.60 %
